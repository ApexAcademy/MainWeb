I had a really bad chemistry teacher at school, but with Ben’s help, I managed to do well both on the AP exam as well as the SAT II subject test. He also helped me become a National Merit Finalist, which I consider to be one of the prouder accomplishments of my life. If you’re looking for someone who can explain complicated concepts in easy-to-understand language, Ben is your guy. This guy really knows science, from chemistry to biology to physics. On top of that, Ben is really good about keeping in touch with his students. Even after I graduated, we continued to meet for lunch/dinner to catch up on life.” </h6>

I guess I just realized it after unconsciously using it for all this time, but I still remember it with the order that Ben taught me: RMI visible UXG. Hydrogen bonds are still FONny and ochem naming is still probably most fun for me :) I realized that I never got to thank Ben for teaching me chemistry for the first time last summer, because in the last three years of high school, it's honestly become one of my favorite subjects that I'm now considering as my major in college (either that or bio!).

        Since last summer, I've been referencing Ben’s notes for the AP test and SAT II and they've helped me tremendously, especially in chem olympiad, too. I hope other students get to experience Ben because he is a great chem instructor :)
        
        PS I was able to get a 5 on the AP test and 800 for SAT II thanks to Ben’s notes. Thank you for all your help!!”

          <h6 class="ben-text">“When I first started my college process, I was overwhelmed with everything from navigating how to write college essays to prepping for the SAT.  I went to various more well-known test prep companies who all promised me they could get me good scores.  Those scores never came even when I put in the work.  If I wouldn’t understand something, they wouldn’t care and just move on.  I realized that to them, I was just money in the bank, and they were just trying to get as many students as they could. I never felt like I got the attention and help that I needed until I met Ben.  He raised my ACT score in one week, more than any of those other bigger companies did in one year.  Before I met him, my best ACT score was a 27.  By the time I finished prepping with Ben, it had been raised to a 34.  However, Ben isn’t only amazing at helping you prepare for tests, he genuinely cares about you as a person, which helped motivate me to study even harder.  He will pinpoint your exact weaknesses and strengths and devote 110% of his efforts into making you the best student you can possibly be.  Not only did Ben help me get my test scores up, but he actually unconsciously made my work ethic better, which had transferred to improvement in my grades in classes Ben hadn’t even tutored me on.  I’ve known Ben for 3 years and only physically seen him in person for 7 days, but I can confidently say I would not have gotten this far both as a student and as a human being in life without his help.  I have nothing but positives to say about my experience with Ben and I would definitely recommend him to anybody looking to improve their grades or test scores.”</h6>
